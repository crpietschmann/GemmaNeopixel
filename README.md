# GemmaNeopixel

This project contains a couple Arduino Sketches for use with an Adafruit Gemma and Neopixel ring.
The harddware used is the same as in the [Adafruit Superhero Powerplant project](https://learn.adafruit.com/superhero-power-plant/overview)

This code should work with an Arduino Gemma too, but it hasn't been tested with that board yet.
